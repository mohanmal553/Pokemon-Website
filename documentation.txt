======== Fetch data from API ========
-> Store the API into a variable
-> Create a function Which fatch the API i.e. fetchPokemon()
-> We using a API which provide an array of pokemon
-> Each pokemon have it's own API
-> We need to fetch them again
-> Using map we we get each API and fetch them and find the data & returning as a promise
-> Now retrieve all data from promise i.e Promise.all
-> Data can be modify so we store them into a state variable
-> Use a loading state variable when API is loading show loading otherwise render the document
-> Now using the map function we access the data which is store into the state variable

======== Search Card by name ========
-> Set a state variable which track the current input i.e [search,setSearch]
-> Filter the card by name and return the match card
-> When not searching return all card otherwise return match card
-> Now we use searchData.map() insted if pokemon.map()
-> Because we want to rendering specific card
